The project aims to uncover patterns, trends, and insights within the dataset through the creation of various graphs and plots.
Here I utilized Python and popular data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create diverse graphs. The visualizations include scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, and more, each tailored to highlight specific aspects of the data. These graphs shed light on meaningful insights in data .
Feel free to explore the 'code' directory to review the Python scripts used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and plotting. 
Your feedback is welcome, and I hope this project provides valuable insights into the dataset. Happy exploring!
